\description{
As the BTT calibrations performed automatically, and are less likley to be incorrect than an Aircraft Calibration, the user
is not asked whether they are good or bad on a per cal basis. This function provides some broad error catching for bad cals.
If the calibration parameters drift outside of a set percetange away from the average *nominal*, they are converted to NA
